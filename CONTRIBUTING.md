## What is Hacktoberfest? :computer:
Hacktoberfest is DigitalOcean‚Äôs annual event that encourages people to contribute to open source throughout October. Much of modern tech infrastructure‚Äîincluding some of DigitalOcean‚Äôs own products‚Äîrelies on open-source projects built and maintained by passionate people who often don‚Äôt have the staff or budgets to do much more than keep the project alive. Hacktoberfest is all about giving back to those projects, sharpening skills.

## What is OpenSource?üìñ
Opensource is a [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code) that is made freely available for possible modification and redistribution. This includes permission to use the source code, design documents, or content. The open-source model is a decentralized software development model that encourages open collaboration. A main principle of open-source software development is peer production, with products such as source code, blueprints, and documentation freely available to the public. The open-source movement in software began as a response to the limitations of [proprietary code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software).

## Step 2 - CLONE:
Clone(download) it to your local machine.   
`use this command`
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Your_Username/HacktoberfestNISB.git
```
-This will create a local copy of the repository in your machine.
-move to this folder for the next steps(current working directory).

## Step 3 - Creating referance‚è´
Add a reference to the original HacktoberfestNISB (NISB)repository using the below command (Remember that you are currently working on the repository forked to your account, it is necessary that you create a link to the main NISB repository).
```sh
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/nisbweb/HacktoberfestNISB.git
```
`This adds new remotes named upstream.`    
To check - use
```sh
$ git remote -v
```
You should get
```sh
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/HacktoberfestNISB.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/HacktoberfestNISB.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/Remote_Username/HacktoberfestNISB.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/Remote_Username/HacktoberfestNISB.git (push)
```

## Step 4: Keep it updated!‚ôªÔ∏è
Make sure that your local copy is always updated with the original repository.   
use
```sh
$ git pull upstream main
```
## Step 5 :arrow_down:
Now you are ready to update your contribution by sending a PR !!!.    
-First create a branch and add all your files to it.   
1.
```sh
# Create a new branch with name branch_Name
$ git checkout -b BranchName
```   
2.
```sh
# To switch to that branch
$ git checkout BranchName
```   
3.
```sh
# To add all files to the branch 
$ git add .    
# commit the changes
$ git commit -m "your-name"
```   

At the end, push the work you have done to your remote repository using
```sh
# Push your work to your remote repository
$ git push origin <branchName>
```

## Step 6
Now go to your repository in the browser and click on contribute > Open pull request.
Then add a title, explain in brief what you have done and send the PR!.
